# NonogramData

Created: 14.01.2019 (first version)

Version: 1.0

Purpose:
The overall aim is to determine to what degree the order in which lines in a nonogram column or row are fully solved can be predicted by these lines' attributes (e.g. the number of blocks it contains).

To do this, the available data is first placed in a database, from where it can be retrieved, converted and analysed statistically.

Should this part be successfully completed, the next aim is to build a website to show unsolved nonograms, and record the traits of the nonogram-resolving process in the database for future analysis.

Requirements: Existing MySQL database and web server. Python 3.8 is also used.
