# NonogramData

Created: 14.01.2019 (first version)

Version: 1.0

Purpose:
The overall aim is to determine to what degree the order in which lines in a nonogram column or row are fully solved can be predicted by these lines' attributes (e.g. the number of blocks it contains) prior to any attempt to solve a puzzle.

To do this, the available data is placed in a database, from where it can be retrieved, converted and analysed statistically. The statistics will be used to create a program and/or equation to predict the order in which lines are resolved.

Should this part be successfully completed, the next aim is to build a website to show unsolved nonograms, and record the traits of the nonogram-resolving process in the database for finetuning and analysis of the existing prediction method(s).

Requirements: Existing MySQL database and web server. Python 3.8 is also used.
